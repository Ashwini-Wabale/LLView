# LLview Server

LLview Server is the module responsible to transfer the collected metrics (obtained by [LLview Remote](remote.md)) into SQLite3 databases, process them and send the required files to the Web Server to be presented for the user via the JÃ¼lich Reporting Interface [JURI](juri.md).

## Configurations

### `.llview_server_rc`

The main configuration file of LLview Server is `.llview_server_rc`, that should be put on the home folder `~`.
This file export environment variables that will be used by the different scripts of LLview.
The existing variables are:

- `$LLVIEW_SYSTEMNAME`: Defines the system name
- `$LLVIEW_HOME`: LLview's home folder, where the repo was cloned
- `$LLVIEW_DATA`: Folder in which the data will be stored. It is also possible to use another hard drive or file system (depending on the amount of metrics, this may be recommended). Either the driver is directly mounted and defined in `$LLVIEW_DATA`, or a symbolic link is created:
    ```
    ln -s /externalvolume/ $LLVIEW_DATA
    ```
- `$LLVIEW_CONF`: Folder with the configuration files (example configuration files is given in `$LLVIEW_HOME/configs`)
- `JUREPTOOL_NPROCS`: Number of processors used by JuRepTool (default: 2). As JuRepTool runs in parallel to the main LLview workflow, it is recommended to initially use `JUREPTOOL_NPROCS=0` to deactivate JuRepTool and only activate it when the full LLview cycle is working.
- `$LLVIEW_SHARED`: A shared folder between LLview Server and [LLview Remote](remote.md), where the generated files from Remote will be written and read by the Server (therefore, it must be the same set up in `.llview_remote_rc` in the Remote part)
- `$LLVIEW_SHUTDOWN`: File to be used to stop LLview's workflow (the cronjob runs, but immediately stops)
- `$LLVIEW_LOG_DAYS`: Number of days to keep the logs

Extra definitions can be also exported in this file (for example, to satisfy the [Dependencies](index.md#software-dependencies)).

### Actions

The collection and processing of data is done via actions (the first workflow level), which can contain many steps (second workflow level) each.
**It is recommended to activate actions and steps inside actions little by little**, and follow the `errlog` files, to find eventual issues and solve them as they appear.

- Edit action file `$LLVIEW_CONF/server/workflows/actions.inp` to the relevant actions to be used. It is recommended to start with `active=0` for all actions and activate them one by one.
- Edit the configuration options for each action (e.g. `$LLVIEW_CONF/server/workflows/LML_da_dbupdate.conf`), when needed. It is recommended to start all steps with `active="0"` and activate them little by little. (**Note**: a step may have dependencies that must be activated before or together with it.)
- Important reminders:
    - <a name="checkDB"></a> After making changes on the configurations that afect the databases (i.e., adding or removing tables), they must be updated. To avoid corrupting the databases or losing data, this step must be done manually. To update the databases according to the new configurations, the following `checkDB` command should be run:
        ```
        . ~/.llview_server_rc; cd $LLVIEW_DATA/$LLVIEW_SYSTEMNAME;
        $LLVIEW_HOME/da/LLmonDB/LLmonDB_mngt.pl -config=$LLVIEW_CONF/server/LLgenDB/LLgenDB.yaml --force checkDB > logs/checkDBv1.`date +%Y.%m.%d`.log 2>&1
        ```
    The file ```$LLVIEW_DATA/$LLVIEW_SYSTEMNAME/logs/checkDBv1.`date +%Y.%m.%d`.log``` can then be checked for errors. There is no problem running this command when the change in the configuration does not affect the databases, so it is recommended to run it after changes in the YAML files.

#### `dbupdate`

The `dbupdate` action mainly performs the collection of metrics into SQLite databases (plus other tasks such as archiving). The configuration of the different databases and their columns, types and values are done via the YAML files inside the `$LLVIEW_CONF/server/LLgenDB` folder.

##### `webservice`

To be able to set up the role-based access of LLview (where users will have access only to their own jobs and projects, while mentors can see jobs on all mentored projects and support can see all jobs), information on the user accounts and projects are needed. This is obtained in the `webservice` step of the `dbupdate` action. In the provided example configuration, this information is obtained via a script `$LLVIEW_HOME/da/rms/JSCinternal/get_webservice_accounts.pl` (not-provided) that is run at every 15th update (via the provided script `$LLVIEW_HOME/da/utils/exec_every_n_step_or_empty.pl`) to avoid too many connections to the database. The output of this step should be put in the file `$LLVIEW_DATA/$LLVIEW_SYSTEMNAME/perm/wservice/accountmap.xml` that contains information to be added in the database. A mockup example of this file is the following:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

            <data key="projects" value="project1,project2,project3"/>

            <data key="wsaccount" value="username3"/>
        </info>
    </information>
</lml:lgui>
```
This example includes:

* Two mentors:
    * `username1` is a mentor of projects `project1,project2`
    * `username2` is a mentor of project `project3`
* Two PIs:
    * `username1` is the leader of project `project1`
    * `username3` is the leader of projects `project2,project3`
* One PA:
    * `username3` is the administrator of project `project1`
* One support:
    * `username1` belongs to the support staff
* Two users:
    * `username1` is a user of projects `project1,project2,project3`
    * `username3` is a user of project `project3`

Notes:

* It is important that the object `id` in the list of objects to be the same as the `oid` in the `<info>` element that defines it below.
* To avoid duplication of names in the objects, we add the suffixes `_L` and `_A` to the usernames for the Principal Investigator (PI), i.e., the leader of a project and Project Administrator (PA), respectively. These letters are also passed as the value of the keys `kind` inside the respective `<info>` element.
* The key `wsaccount` should contain the user name used to login to the web service.
* The groups can have overlap, i.e., a user can be support, mentor, PI/PA and user of a project.
* A user does not need to be defined in all places. In particular, they can be from support and/or mentor, but not be part of any project.
* The `ts` key should include the timestamp the data was acquired.
* Identation is not necessary.

#### `jobreport`

The `jobreport` action maily creates the data to be presented to the user and copies them to the Web Server. Its configuration is also done via the YAML files inside the `$LLVIEW_CONF/server/LLgenDB` folder.

##### `transferreports`

The `transferreports` step inside the `jobreport` action is used to transfer data securely from the LLview Server to the Web Server. To use this step as it is by default, it is necessary to create an ssh-key pair:
    ```
    cd $LLVIEW_DATA/$SYSTEMNAME/perm/
    mkdir keys
    cd keys
    ssh-keygen -a 100 -t ed25519 -C âLLview job report transport from LLview-Serverâ -f www_llview_system_jobreport
    ```
This must be created without any passphrase.
Then, on the Web Server, the public part of the key must be added in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` as:
    ```
    from="<ip of LLview server>",command="<path to rrsync>/rrsync.pl -wo <folder where data will be copied into>",no-agent-forwarding,no-port-forwarding,no-pty,no-user-rc,no-X11-forwarding <complete public part of the ssh-key>
    ```
**Note:** the line above must be adapted to include the correct IP where the LLview Server part is running, the path to `rrsync.pl` on the web server (this tool is packed with JURI in the folder `$JURI_HOME/utils`), and the public part of the key created above.
Finally, the command itself must be updated with the correct values for:
    ```            
    -sshkey $permdir/keys/www_llview_system_jobreport
    -login <login on the web server>
    -port <port used>
    -desthost <webserver address>
    ```
**Note:** An initial login may be needed to accept the authenticity of the host (`ssh <login>@<webserver address>` and then `yes` is enough, even if you get "Permission denied" afterwards)

#### `compress` and `archive`

The actions `compress` and `archive` perform actions that are created on the previous steps on the folder `${LLVIEW_DATA}/${LLVIEW_SYSTEMNAME}/tmp/jobreport/tmp/mngtactions`. They are important to keep the `${LLVIEW_DATA}/${LLVIEW_SYSTEMNAME}/tmp/jobreport/data` folder clean.

### JuRepTool

JuRepTool is the LLview module that generates the PDF and HTML reports. It runs in parallel alongside LLview's main workflow, and the generated files are automatically copied and made available on the LLview portal.
To setup and use JuRepTool:

- Update the config files located under `$LLVIEW_CONF/server/jureptool`. The configuration of the script and plots are given in 4 YAML files:
    - `config.yml`: General configuration such as fontsize, page size, colors, etc. (env vars can be used here)
    - `system_info.yml`: Information on the system names, queues and sizes (cores, CPU and GPU memory)
    - `plots.yml`: Configuration of sections and the graphs to be plotted in each of them. Keywords from `system_info.yml` may be used in `ylim`.
    - `logging.yml`: Logging information (filename, format, level)
- Add required fonts (Liberation Sans or Arial, Liberation Mono or Courier New). Liberation fonts are Open Source and can be downloaded from [Liberation Fonts' GitHub](https://github.com/liberationfonts/liberation-fonts/releases).
Fonts can be installed with:
    ```
    mkdir ~/.local/share/fonts/
    cp <fonts_folder>/*.ttf ~/.local/share/fonts/
    fc-cache -f
    rm -fr ~/.cache/matplotlib
    ```
- Give a non-zero value for the number of processes to be used by JuRepTool via the variable `$JUREPTOOL_NPROCS` in `.llview_server_rc`.

## Folder Structure

The generated files are put into the folder defined in `$LLVIEW_DATA/$LLVIEW_SYSTEMNAME`.
The subfolders that used for the default steps are:

- `monitor`: Location of the log files for the main monitor script (that is run by the cronjob)
- `logs`: Location of the log files
    - `steps`: Folder storing temporary log files for each step of all actions that are created and overwritten during every cycle and also permanent error files that happen during the steps
- `perm`: Folder used by LLview to store files indicating a job is running, counters
    - `db`: Folder where SQLite databases are located
    - `keys`: Where SSH-keys for the [transferreports](#transferreports) step are stored
    - `wservice`: Store the mapping of the Web Service accounts
- `tmp`: Location of the temporary LML files (e.g., the ones copied from `$LLVIEW_SHARED`)
    - `jobreport`: Files generated by the `jobreport` action
        - `data`: Folder that is copied to the Web Server
        - `tmp`: Contains the list of jobs JuRepTool needs to process and management files
- `arch`: Location of the archived files
    - `db`: csv files containing DB information
    - `LMLall`: Daily tarballs containing combined information of jobs
- `jureptool`: Folder used for temporary JuRepTool files and also location of default `shutdown` file (that stops only JuRepTool)
    - `results`: Where reports are first generated, and then moved to their final location (to avoid problems during copy to the Web Server)

## Installation Instructions

- Make sure the [dependencies](#dependencies) are satisfied
- Get LLview:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/FZJ-JSC/LLview.git
    ```
This is where the `$LLVIEW_HOME` should be defined below, and the instructions use this notation.


- Configuration:
    - **[Optional]** Copy and update config folder in `$LLVIEW_CONF` (an example is given in `$LLVIEW_HOME/configs`)
    This folder contains all the configuration files which defines the specific configuration of what is collected and what will be presented to the users.
    **Note:** The folder structure should be kept, as some scripts use `$LLVIEW_CONF/server/(...)`.
    - Edit `.llview_server_rc` (an example is given in `$LLVIEW_HOME/configs/server`) and put it in the home folder `~/`, as this is the basic configuration file and it is the only way to guarantee it is a known folder at this point. The possible options are [listed below](#llview_server_rc).
    - Edit the `$LLVIEW_CONF/LLgenDB`: here is the whole configuration of metrics, databases, etc. This can also be adapted later, but changes here may require the [checkDB](#checkDB) command to be run to update the databases.
- Source the main configuration file, to be able to use the variable in the next steps: 
    ```
    . ~/.llview_server_rc
    ```
- Add cronjob to crontab:
    ```
    crontab $LLVIEW_HOME/da/workflows/server/crontab/crontab.add
    ```
Check if the cronjob is added correctly:
    ```
    $ crontab -l
    # start monitor daemon
    * * * * * . ~/.llview_server_rc ; perl "$LLVIEW_HOME/da/workflows/server/crontab/serverAll.pl"
    ```

The server part of LLview involves a daemon that starts to run the first time the `serverAll.pl` script is called. Further calls will check if it is already running, and will restart it in case it is not. This script will then run the different [actions](#actions), which can be triggered in different ways (as an example, the basic [`dbupdate` action](#dbupdate) monitors when a signal file was changed to start the process of copying and processing the data).

The monitor daemon of LLview Server can be stopped either by `touch $LLVIEW_SHUTDOWN` (this file should be defined in `.llview_server_rc`) or killing the `monitor_file.pl` process. Note that the cronjob still restarts every minute - if `$LLVIEW_SHUTDOWN` exists, the process immediately stops without starting the daemon. To remove it altogether, additionally delete/comment out the cronjob (editing with `crontab -e`).
